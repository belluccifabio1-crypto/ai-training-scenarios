# AI Training Scenarios – Code Evaluation & Reasoning

This repository contains structured scenarios designed to support AI training
and evaluation tasks.

The main focus is on:
- Code correctness and expected behavior
- Identifying edge cases
- Explaining technical decisions clearly
- Writing structured reasoning for reviewers and AI systems

## Scope
The examples in this repository are intentionally simple in implementation,
but advanced in analysis and documentation.

## Repository Structure
- scenarios/: Python examples covering common validation and logic cases
- documentation/: Written explanations of evaluation criteria and edge cases

This project was created as part of hands-on practice for AI evaluation
and reasoning-focused tasks.
