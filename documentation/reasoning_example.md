# Example of Code Reasoning

This document describes how code behavior is evaluated in AI training tasks.

## Scenario
The goal is to validate user input and clearly distinguish between valid and invalid cases.

## Reasoning Steps
1. Check for empty or missing input.
2. Validate format and basic rules.
3. Return a clear and structured response.
4. Make error cases explicit and easy to understand.

## Why This Matters
Clear reasoning helps both human reviewers and AI systems
understand why a specific output is correct or incorrect.
